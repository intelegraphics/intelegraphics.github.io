        <h1>App Support And User Privacy</h1>
        <p>
        This app respects and protects your privacy. This policy aims to clearly explain how we handle information related to you.  <br>
        
        1. Core Commitment: We Do Not Collect Your Personal Information  <br>
        
        No Collection of Personal Information:
        We solemnly declare that this product does not actively collect, store, use, or transmit any of your personal information in any form. This includes, but is not limited to:  <br>
        - Personally identifiable information such as your name, address, phone number, or email.  <br>
        - Account security details including usernames, passwords, or payment information. <br>
        - Location data, device identifiers (e.g., IMEI, IDFA), or IP addresses.  <br>
        - Usage data like browsing history, search queries, input content, or uploaded files.  <br>
        - Any other data that could directly or indirectly identify you.  <br>
        <br>
        No Third-Party SDKs:  <br>
        This product does not integrate any third-party software development kits (SDKs), eliminating any possibility of indirect data collection through such means. <br>
        <br>
        2. Technical Information We Process  <br>
        <br>
        We do not collect any personal information from users, including but not limited to biometric data or physical device information. We collect no data from you whatsoever.  <br>
        <br>
        3. Information Sharing & Disclosure  <br>
        <br>
        No Sharing of Personal Information:  <br>
        Since we collect no personal data, we do not share, sell, rent, or transfer it to any third parties under any circumstances. <br>
        <br>
        4. Information Security  <br>
        <br>
        No Personal Data Risks:  <br>
        As we retain no personal information, there is zero risk of its leakage, loss, or damage due to our operations.<br>
        <br>
        Technical Data Protection:<br>
        We implement reasonable measures (HTTPS encryption, server security configurations, regular log audits) to safeguard server and anonymized technical data against unauthorized access or breaches.
        <br> <br>
        5. Your Rights  <br>
        <br>
        No Personal Data Rights Apply:  <br>
        Given our strict no-collection policy, you need not submit requests to access, correct, delete, or port personal data, nor withdraw consent or close accounts.

        6. Policy Updates  <br>
        
        We may revise this policy to comply with laws, reflect product changes, or meet operational needs. <br>
        - Updated versions will be posted here with revised "Last Updated" and "Effective" dates. <br>
        - Major changes are unlikely as our core principle (no data collection) remains immutable. <br>
        - Periodic review of this page is recommended.  <br>
